# 🧬 scIDiff: Schrödinger Bridge Learning of Single-Cell Regulatory Dynamics

scIDiff (single-cell inverse Diffusion) is a computational framework that learns the causal, time-symmetric dynamics of cellular identity directly from single-cell data.
By framing development, differentiation, and reprogramming as a Schrödinger-Bridge inverse-diffusion problem, scQDiff infers both forward and reverse drift fields that describe how cells evolve through transcriptional space—and how these processes could, in principle, be reversed.
Unlike conventional optimal-transport or score-based methods that follow purely energy-minimal paths, scQDiff incorporates biological priors such as RNA velocity vector fields from Dynamo.
These velocity priors anchor the Schrödinger-Bridge optimization to biochemically feasible directions of change, ensuring that the inferred stochastic paths are biologically meaningful, not just mathematically minimal.
The result is a hybrid model—where RNA-velocity-guided kinetics inform the local drift, while the Schrödinger-Bridge regularization guarantees global time-symmetry and probabilistic consistency.
From the learned drifts, scQDiff computes temporal Jacobian tensors that capture how gene-gene and cell-cell influences evolve through time.
Decomposing these tensors via singular-value or tensor factorization reveals regulatory archetypes (intracellular control programs) and communication archetypes (intercellular signaling modules).
By comparing forward and reverse archetypes, scQDiff quantifies biological irreversibility, identifies commitment points, and highlights reprogramming factors that can potentially restore lost plasticity—analogous to Yamanaka-like regulators.

Through this unified approach, scQDiff bridges optimal transport, RNA-velocity kinetics, and stochastic thermodynamics, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and experimentally testable framework for causal modeling of cell fate and beyond.
`scIDiff` unifies the principles of optimal transport and score-based generative modeling to provide a physically-grounded, yet biologically-interpretable, model of cellular dynamics.

## 🌌 Mathematical Foundations

Given observed cell states sampled at different times or perturbation conditions, scIDiff models a stochastic process:

$$dX_t = u(X_t, t)dt + \sqrt{2\beta}dW_t$$

- $X_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$ — cell state (e.g., transcriptome)
- $u(X_t,t)$ — drift field (regulatory flow learned by scIDiff)
- $\beta$ — diffusion constant
- $dW_t$ — Brownian noise

The learned drift transports the empirical initial distribution $\rho_0$ to the terminal $\rho_1$ while minimizing a Schrödinger-Bridge energy:

$$\min_{u} \mathbb{E}[\int_0^1 \frac{1}{2\beta} \|u(X_t,t)\|^2 dt] \quad \text{s.t.} \quad X_0 \sim \rho_0, X_1 \sim \rho_1$$

The drift $u(x,t)$ satisfies the Schrödinger Bridge system:

$$u(x,t) = \nabla\log\phi(x,t) + \nabla\log\hat{\phi}(x,t)$$

where $(\phi,\hat{\phi})$ solve the Schrödinger half-bridge equations.

A temporal Jacobian

$$J(t) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(t)$$

encodes local, causal gene-to-gene influence along time, where $J_{ij}(t) = \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}$ quantifies how gene $j$ influences the expression rate of gene $i$ at time $t$, providing dynamic GRN inference.

## 🔁 Forward and Reverse Drift

scIDiff learns both forward and reverse drift fields:

**Forward:**
$$dX_t = u(X_t, t)dt + \sqrt{2\beta}dW_t$$

**Reverse:**
$$dX_t = [u(X_t, t) - 2\beta\nabla_x\log\rho_t(X_t)]dt + \sqrt{2\beta}d\bar{W}_t$$

- The forward drift $u(x,t)$ describes how cells evolve naturally.
- The reverse drift captures how much "work" would be required to reprogram cells backward in time (e.g., iPSC or rejuvenation).

The difference $\Delta u = u_{\text{fwd}} - u_{\text{rev}}$ quantifies irreversibility — an analog of biological entropy production. This forward–reverse asymmetry provides a rigorous way to identify irreversible cell-fate decisions and the regulators (Yamanaka-like factors) capable of reversing them.

### Temporal Jacobians and Archetype Decomposition

scIDiff computes the temporal Jacobian tensors for both the forward ($J_{\text{fwd}}$) and reverse ($J_{\text{rev}}$) drift fields:

$$J_{\text{fwd}}(t) = \frac{\partial u_{\text{fwd}}}{\partial x}(t) \quad \text{and} \quad J_{\text{rev}}(t) = \frac{\partial u_{\text{rev}}}{\partial x}(t)$$

These Jacobians represent the instantaneous, causal influence of each gene on the expression rate of every other gene at a specific time $t$. To uncover the dominant modes of regulation and communication, scIDiff performs Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on these tensors.

For a given Jacobian $J(t)$, the SVD is:

$$J(t) = U \Sigma V^T$$

- **Regulatory Archetypes (U):** The left singular vectors (columns of $U$) represent co-regulated gene modules, or *regulatory archetypes*, that are active during the process.
- **Communication Archetypes (V):** The right singular vectors (columns of $V$) correspond to the cellular states that are most influential, forming *communication archetypes*.

This decomposition provides a low-rank approximation of the complex, high-dimensional regulatory dynamics, revealing the underlying structure of gene regulation during both forward (e.g., differentiation) and reverse (e.g., reprogramming) processes.

### 🧬 Biological Guidance with RNA Velocity

While the Schrödinger Bridge finds the most probable path between two cell populations, this path is a mathematical optimum—the "straightest line" through a high-dimensional landscape. Biological processes, however, rarely take the straightest path. They are constrained by the intricate machinery of gene regulation.

To ensure our model respects these biological rules, `scIDiff` incorporates RNA velocity as a **biological compass**. By measuring the ratio of newly transcribed (unspliced) to mature (spliced) mRNA, RNA velocity provides a direct readout of the cell's immediate future—the direction it is *actually* moving in the next instant.

`scIDiff` uses this information not as a rigid constraint, but as a powerful guiding force. As it computes the long-range trajectory between cell states, it continuously checks its direction against the local, instantaneous vectors provided by RNA velocity. This ensures the global path is composed of steps that are mechanistically plausible and consistent with the cell's internal transcriptional dynamics.

The result is a model that balances global optimality with local biological realism, producing trajectories that are not just mathematically probable, but also biologically faithful.

## 🧠 What scIDiff Learns

| Layer                  | Description                                      | Output                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Regulatory drift       | Deterministic direction of transcriptional change | $u(x,t)$                          |
| Reverse drift          | Reprogramming direction opposing natural evolution | $u_{\text{rev}}(x,t)$             |
| Irreversibility field  | Entropic asymmetry between forward and reverse   | $\Delta u = u - u_{\text{rev}}$   |
| Temporal Jacobian      | Local causal gene-to-gene influence              | $J(t)=\tfrac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ |
| Regulatory archetypes  | Low-rank modes of temporal regulation            | $u(x,t)\approx\sum_k a_k(t)A_kx$ |
| (Optional) Communication | Dynamic ligand–receptor signaling between cells    | $W_{ij}(t)$                       |

**Biological Insight:** The learned drift $u(x,t)$ captures:

- Attractors as zeros of $u(x,t)$ (fixed points)
- Differentiation paths as flow lines of $u(x,t)$
- Barriers as regions where $|u(x,t)|$ is large (rapid transitions)

## 🔗 Extension: scIDiff-Comm (Cell–Cell Communication)

With CellPhoneDB ligand–receptor priors, scIDiff models time-evolving communication graphs as coupled stochastic processes:

$$dX_t^{(i)} = u_{\text{intra}}(X_t^{(i)}, t)dt + \sum_j W_{ij}(t)f(X_t^{(j)} - X_t^{(i)})dt + \sqrt{2\beta}dW_t^{(i)}$$

- $W_{ij}(t)$ — communication strength between cells *i* and *j*
- $f(\Delta x)$ — interaction kernel (e.g., linear or gated)

**Result:** Communication archetypes (e.g., inflammatory relay, exhaustion/resolution) that co-evolve with regulatory drift.

## ⚖️ Quantifying Irreversibility

scIDiff computes entropy production and cycle flux metrics to measure the degree of biological irreversibility:

$$\dot{S}(t) = \frac{1}{\beta} \mathbb{E}[u(X_t,t) \cdot \nabla\log\rho_t(X_t)] = \mathbb{E}[\frac{\|u(X_t,t) - u_{\text{rev}}(X_t,t)\|^2}{2\beta}]$$

- High $\dot{S}(t)$ → irreversible differentiation (e.g., commitment, exhaustion)
- Low $\dot{S}(t)$ → reversible or plastic states (e.g., stem, progenitor)

This enables principled identification of control nodes capable of restoring reversibility.
